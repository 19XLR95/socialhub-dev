# SocialHub API documentation

This is the repository of the [**socialhub.dev**](https://socialhub.dev/) website.

## Structure

It's based on [docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/) with all the documentation written in Markdown within the [`/docs`](/docs) directory.

Additionally there's a [Swagger API Specification](https://swagger.io/) file at [`/swagger.yaml`](/swagger.yaml).

Website deployment happens automatically via GitHub workflows by simply merging or pushing changes to master. The site will be build and the build will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch which is exposed as a GitHub site.

## Questions

Please feel free to ask any documentation related questions you have by [creating an issue](/issues/new).
